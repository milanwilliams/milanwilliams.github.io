## Introduction ðŸ‘‹

Hi! I'm Milan Williams. I build security products that developers love.

I'm a Senior Product Manager at [Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/), a high-growth cybersecurity startup. I lead the teams responsible for Semgrep Code (SAST) and Secrets detection products.

Before Semgrep, I graduated from Harvard University with degrees in Computer Science and Physics. In my free time, you can find me geeking about the latest in security / developer tooling, running in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, or enjoying local theater! ðŸ’›
