Hi! I'm Milan Williams. I build security products that developers love.

I'm a Senior Product Manager at [Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/), a high-growth cybersecurity startup. I lead the teams responsible for Semgrep Code (SAST) and Secrets detection products.

Before Semgrep, I graduated from Harvard University with degrees in Computer Science and Physics, where I spent most of my time in the [Adams House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adams_House_(Harvard_College)) library. ❤️💛

In my free time, you can find me geeking about the latest in security / developer tooling, running in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, or enjoying local theater.
